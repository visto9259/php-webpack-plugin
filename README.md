## PHP Webpack Plugin

_This module will work only with Webpack 4 and above._

This [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) plugin will create a PHP file in your output.path directory containing an associative arrays of entry points and their corresponding chunk groups.

The resulting file can be used by your PHP application to determine which files should be included when rendering your
frontend of your website.

Companion [Zend](https://docs.zendframework.com) and [Laminas](https://getlaminas.org) framework modules are in the works to automate the rendering of script tags using the output of
this plugin.
